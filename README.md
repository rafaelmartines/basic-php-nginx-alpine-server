# Basic PHP Server build with Alpine and Nginx

This is a basic Docker PHP Server to easily setup an enviroment for development and tests.

My target was that the container image could be minimal as possible, such that once build, the image is under 100MB size.

Check what you will find on specs

* PHP 7.4.30
* Alpine 3.16.0
* Nginx 1.22.0

Tested on WSL.
